📈 Stock Trading Platform (Java)
Stock Trading Platform is a simple Java console-based application that simulates basic stock market operations. Users can view available market stocks, buy and sell shares, track their investment portfolio, and manage their account balance. The system saves portfolio data to a file so progress is preserved between program runs.
